# Interfacing Libraries for ATmega328P and Arduino Framework

## About this Repository

This repository brings up some libraries in C/C++ to make easier the interface of some components with the ATmega328P microcontroller and Arduino Framework. The libraries cover drivers for LCD modules, rotaty encoders, accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers as well as some interesting implementations like PID controllers, moving average and hysteresis filters.
