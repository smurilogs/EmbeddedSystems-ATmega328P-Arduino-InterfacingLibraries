# Interfacing Libraries for ATmega328P and Arduino Framework

## About this Repository

This repository brings up some libraries in C/C++ to make easier the interface of some components and logic structures with the ATmega328P microcontroller and Arduino Framework. The libraries cover drivers for 2-channel rotary encoder HD44780 LCD module, ADXL345 accelerometer, L3G4200D gyroscope, HMC5883L magnetometer as well as some interesting implementations for control and state estimation like PID controllers, moving average, hysteresis and complementary filters.
