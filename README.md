# Interfacing Libraries for ATmega328P and Arduino Framework

## About this Repository

This repository brings up some libraries in C/C++ to make easier the interface of some components and logic structures with the ATmega328P microcontroller and Arduino Framework. The libraries cover drivers for 2-channel rotary encoder HD44780 LCD modules, ADXL345 accelerometer, L3G4200D gyroscope, HMC5883L magnetometer as well as some interesting implementations like PID controllers, moving average and hysteresis filters.
